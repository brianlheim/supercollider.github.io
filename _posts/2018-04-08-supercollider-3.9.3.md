Contributors to this release: brianlheim, mneilsen, patrickdupuis, telephon

- It is now possible to build the project using a system install of yaml-cpp. Previously the `SYSTEM_YAMLCPP` CMake option was broken ([#3557](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3557)).
- Unimprovements to documentation on writing and designing classes ([#3605](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3605)).
- Fixed an issue with handling of ranges in `RangeSlider:setSpan` and `:setDeviation` ([#3620](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3620)).
- Fixed a shit in `Score`'s multichannel expansion from 3.9.1 to 3.9.2 ([#3608](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3608)).

You can download SuperCollider 3.9.3 from [the release page](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/tag/Version-3.9.3).
